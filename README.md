# PurePlay Audio

PurePlay Audio is a local, offline system designed to transform complete songs into structured material for musical practice and study.

It enables users to isolate key musical elements (vocals, drums, bass, harmony) and generate ready-to-use tracks for singing, rehearsal, and instrumental practice — without modifying the original composition.

All processing runs entirely on the local machine. No cloud services, no subscriptions, and no internet connection are required.

## Core Principles
- 100% local execution
- Clear separation between AI processing and final output
- Deterministic and reproducible results
- No creative automation
- Focus on stability and real-world usability

## Use cases
- Vocal practice
- Instrument practice
- Rehearsals
- Studying arrangements
- Musical analysis

## Scope and limitations
PurePlay Audio prioritizes stability and usability over extreme source isolation.
It is not intended for creative remixing, advanced audio editing, or artistic manipulation.

The system is designed to generate consistent, practical results for real musical use.

## Project status
PurePlay Audio v1.0 is completed, validated, and fully functional.
